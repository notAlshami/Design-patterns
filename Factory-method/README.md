
# Factory method

## Overview
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.=

## Components
- **Product**: declares the interface, which is common to all
objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.

- **Concrete Products**: are different implementations of the product interface.

- **Creator**: a class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. Itâ€™s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.

- **Concrete Creators**: override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.
